## Features

1. **Technology Stack:**

   Backend:

   - [x] Node.Js Express.Js
   - [x] Tests: Jest
   - [x] Typescript

   Frontend:

   - [x] React
   - [x] Tests: Jest + React-library-testing + cypress
   - [x] Typescript

2. **Displaying Cities:**

   - The frontend fetches cities data from the backend and displays it

3. **City Details in a Modal:**

   - When the user clicks on the "Details" button on a city card, a modal opens, showing the location using OpenMapmore and information about the city.

4. **API Endpoint:**

   - The backend exposes an API endpoint to return cities data in JSON format.

5. **Services and Controllers Architecture:**

   - The application follows a well-structured architecture using services and controllers to organize code logically, promoting maintainability and separation of concerns.

6. **Decorator for Route Configuration:**

   - Implemented decorators to simplify and streamline route configuration.
   - `@controller("/cities")`: A decorator used to define the base path for the cities-related routes.
   - `@GET("/")`: A decorator used to specify the HTTP method and relative path for the route that retrieves cities.

7. **Logger Middleware:**
   - Created a logger middleware to log request details to the console.
   - The logger middleware captures and displays important information about incoming requests, helping in debugging and monitoring.
